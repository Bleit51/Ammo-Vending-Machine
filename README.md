# Ammo-Vending-Machine
Ammo-Vending-Machine, as the name suggests, is a Python simulation of how an Ammo dispenser or vending machine typically displays its functions in Battle Royale games like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite. 

Running the program, you will be displayed a set of instructions of usage. For following through and trying the given instructions, you will get a displayed message (having no inherent meaning as you can't just dispense ammunition through a computer... sadly) of the type of ammunition and quantity of ammunition desired being recieved by the user.

This project is meant to represent how multiple types of vending devices use user input to select and dispense the required output.
